# Setup
## M1 cicd postgres compatibilty

If you get a strange SCRAM error message at authentication (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62807717/how-can-i-solve-postgresql-scram-authentifcation-problem) then change the pg_hba.conf of the cicd_postgres as
follows:

```
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     trust
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
local   replication     all                                     trust
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    replication     all             ::1/128                 trust

# INSERT this line to fix the scram error on M1 chips.
#host all all all scram-sha-256
host all all all trust
```
